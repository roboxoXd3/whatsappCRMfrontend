# Frontend Testing Guide: CRM-Chat Integration

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the **CRM-Chat Integration** feature that enables personalized AI conversations using real-time customer data from the CRM system.

## Feature Summary
- **Before**: AI chatbot showed generic responses with phone numbers
- **After**: AI chatbot provides personalized responses using customer names, company info, lead status, and CRM context
- **Implementation**: Automatic real-time CRM data fetching during message processing

## API Endpoints for Testing

### 1. Customer Context API
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/customer-context/{phone_number}`
**Purpose**: Retrieve comprehensive customer information for personalized responses

#### Test Cases:

##### Test Case 1: Existing Customer (Anisha Gupta)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/customer-context/917014020949"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json

### 2. Bot Status API (Existing)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/bot/status-summary`
**Purpose**: Check which conversations have bot enabled/disabled

### 3. Health Check API
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`
**Purpose**: Verify API is running correctly

## AI Response Comparison

### Before CRM Integration
**User Message**: "Hi, I need help with my project"
**AI Response**: "Hello! I'm here to help you with your project. Could you please tell me more about what you need assistance with?"

### After CRM Integration

#### For Known Customer (Anisha Gupta - Contacted Lead)
**User Message**: "Hi, I need help with my project"
**AI Response**: "Hi Anisha! Great to hear from you again. I see you're the CEO at Rian Infotech and we have an Enterprise Software License deal in negotiation. I notice we have a pending task to send you the proposal document by January 18th. How can I help you with your project today? Are you looking for updates on the proposal or do you have new requirements?"

#### For Known Customer (Rishav - New Lead)
**User Message**: "Hi, I need help with my project"
**AI Response**: "Hello Rishav! Nice to meet you. I see you're a Developer at Tech Solutions. I'm here to help you with your project. Could you please tell me more about what specific assistance you need?"

#### For Unknown Customer
**User Message**: "Hi, I need help with my project"
**AI Response**: "Hello! I'm here to help you with your project. Could you please tell me more about what you need assistance with, and if you'd like, you can share your name and company so I can better assist you."

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Real-time Message Processing Test
1. **Setup**: Ensure bot is enabled for test phone number
2. **Action**: Send WhatsApp message from known customer number
3. **Expected**: AI response includes customer name and context
4. **Verification**: Check logs for customer context retrieval

### Scenario 2: Phone Number Format Compatibility
Test both formats:
- Base number: `917014020949`
- WhatsApp format: `917014020949_s_whatsapp_net`

Both should return the same customer context.

### Scenario 3: CRM Data Update Test
1. **Before**: Get customer context via API
2. **Action**: Update customer info in CRM (name, company, lead status)
3. **After**: Get customer context again via API
4. **Expected**: Updated information reflected immediately

### Scenario 4: Performance Test
- **Endpoint**: `/api/customer-context/{phone_number}`
- **Expected Response Time**: 50-200ms
- **Test**: Multiple concurrent requests
- **Expected**: Consistent performance without errors

## Frontend Integration Points

### 1. Dashboard Enhancement Opportunities
```javascript
// Example: Display customer context in chat interface
const customerContext = await fetch(`/api/customer-context/${phoneNumber}`);
if (customerContext.customer_found) {
  // Show customer name, company, lead status in chat header
  // Display active deals, pending tasks in sidebar
  // Highlight high-priority customers
}
```

### 2. Real-time Updates
```javascript
// Listen for CRM updates and refresh customer context
socket.on('crm_update', (data) => {
  if (data.phone_number === currentChatPhoneNumber) {
    refreshCustomerContext();
  }
});
```

### 3. Customer Context Display
```javascript
// Example customer context component
const CustomerContextCard = ({ phoneNumber }) => {
  const [context, setContext] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/customer-context/${phoneNumber}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setContext(data.customer_context));
  }, [phoneNumber]);
  
  if (!context) return <div>Loading customer info...</div>;
  
  return (
    <div className="customer-context">
      <h3>{context.name} - {context.company}</h3>
      <p>Lead Status: {context.lead_status} (Score: {context.lead_score})</p>
      {context.active_deals?.length > 0 && (
        <div>Active Deals: {context.active_deals.length}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Customer lookup**: ~140ms
- **Deals retrieval**: ~110ms  
- **Tasks retrieval**: ~60ms
- **Activities retrieval**: ~55ms
- **Total response time**: ~200ms

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Database Connection Issues**: Returns generic response
2. **Invalid Phone Number**: Returns "customer not found"
3. **Partial Data**: Gracefully handles missing deals/tasks/activities
4. **API Rate Limits**: Implements retry logic

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Database connection failed",
  "customer_found": false,
  "customer_context": null,
  "context_summary": "Unable to retrieve customer information at this time."
}
```
